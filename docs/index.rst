Olin Wilson Legacy Survey (OWLS)
--------------------------------

Exoplaneteers and stellar atmosphere enthusiasts alike can agree on at least one
thing: knowing the phase and strength of a star's activity cycle is valuable
information which can only be gained through long-term, continuous monitoring
from mid-sized observatories like APO. In this program, we have created a
legacy survey of exoplanet-host star Ca II H & K emission line observations
extending into the distant future with APO/ARCES, which we call the
`Olin Wilson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olin_Chaddock_Wilson>`_
Legacy Survey (OWLS). The time-series database of Ca II H & K measurements will
be a touchstone reference for exoplaneteers to determine the extent of
contamination by stellar activity in their exoplanet observations, as well as a
modern update to the
`Baliunas et al. (1995) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...438..269B/abstract>`_
sample which reveals how the magnetic activity of exoplanet host stars varies
with spectral type, planet orbital period, etc.
